# [Fitness Tracker](https://afternoon-journey-09370.herokuapp.com/stats)

This is an app which allows users to add a workout to the database, then add exercises to that workout. If the user has a latest workout, they will be able to see information about it on the landing page. Otherwise, they will be prompted to create a new workout. On the dashboard, users can view four different charts and graphs displaying information regarding their workouts, as well as their workout completions.
